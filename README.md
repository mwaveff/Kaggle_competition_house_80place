# Kaggle Competition: Housing Prices (Kaggle Learn Users)

This competition is designed for Kaggle Learn users who are just getting started with predictive modeling and machine learning. The goal is to apply the concepts you have learned in the Machine Learning course on Kaggle Learn to a real-world dataset of housing prices. Participants are tasked with predicting the sale prices of residential homes based on a variety of features, including property characteristics, location information, and structural details.

## Competition Overview

- **Objective:** Predict the sale price of homes.
- **Data:** Contains features such as lot size, year built, overall quality, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and more.
- **Audience:** Beginners in machine learning who want to practice predictive modeling.

## Learning Goals

Participants will have the opportunity to:

- Apply regression techniques such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- Perform data preprocessing and handle missing values.
- Conduct feature engineering to create meaningful predictors.
- Tune hyperparameters and evaluate models using cross-validation.
- Explore feature importance to understand which factors most influence housing prices.

## Personal Achievement

I am proud to share that I achieved a rank of **80th place** in this competition! This experience allowed me to apply all the skills learned in the Kaggle Learn course, improve my understanding of regression modeling, feature engineering, and model tuning, and measure my performance against other learners in a competitive environment.

## Why Participate?

- Gain hands-on experience with real-world data.
- Compare your results with other learners and improve your approach.
- Learn best practices in predictive modeling in a supportive Kaggle environment.
- Prepare for more advanced competitions and projects in machine learning.
